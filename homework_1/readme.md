4.	 Four histograms total should be printed. They should display histograms showing the number of seats and capacity of pounds before and after Box-Cox. The skewness values should also be printed in this step.
5.	The proportions of aircrafts that are operating and the corresponding stacked bar chart should be displayed first. The proportion of aircrafts belonging to each aircraft status group and the corresponding stacked bar chart should be displayed next.
